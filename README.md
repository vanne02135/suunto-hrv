suunto-hrv
==========

Use Suunto Ambit to determine heart rate variability. Ambit saves the last log in ~/Library/Application Support/Suunto/Moveslink2 (in Mac OS X), just give the file name on command line. 

For HRV measurement you should record 1-5 minutes of heart rate in the morning with controlled breath 
and no distractions.
